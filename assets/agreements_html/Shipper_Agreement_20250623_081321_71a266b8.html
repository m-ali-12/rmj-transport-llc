                <h3>Shipper Agreement Terms & Conditions</h3>
                <h4 dir="ltr">1. Exclusive Broker Arrangement</h4>
                <p dir="ltr">By signing this agreement, the Client agrees to work exclusively with the Broker for the entire shipping period. If another broker or carrier is engaged during this period, a non-refundable deposit will be retained.</p>
                <h4 dir="ltr">2. Door-to-Door Service</h4>
                <p dir="ltr">Carriers will make every effort to provide door-to-door transport. If the pickup or delivery location has access restrictions, the Client and Carrier will agree upon a nearby meeting point.</p>
                <h4 dir="ltr">3. Transport Authorization</h4>
                <p dir="ltr">The Carrier's driver is fully authorized to transport the vehicle between the pickup and delivery addresses listed. Deposits paid are final and only partially refundable under specific conditions.</p>
                <h4 dir="ltr">4. Personal Items</h4>
                <p dir="ltr">Carriers are not responsible or insured for personal items inside the vehicle. Any items must:
                <ul>
                    <li>• Weigh no more than 100 lbs</li>
                    <li>• Be secured in the trunk</li>
                    <li>• Not interfere with transport operations</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <h4 dir="ltr">5. Vehicle Condition</h4>
                <p dir="ltr">The vehicle must be in good running condition and contain no more than half a tank of fuel. Carriers are not responsible for damage caused by mechanical issues, leaking fluids, or improper loading.</p>
                <h4 dir="ltr">6. Insurance Coverage</h4>
                <p dir="ltr">Carriers maintain insurance coverage ranging from $100,000 to $250,000 per load. Claims for damage during transport are covered by the Carrier's insurance.</p>
                <h4 dir="ltr">7. Market Fluctuations</h4>
                <p dir="ltr">In recognition of market dynamics and evolving transport conditions, rates may be subject to adjustments of up to thirty-five percent prior to dispatch. This ensures that the service remains aligned with current demands and operational factors.</p>
                <h4 dir="ltr">8. Scheduling & Rescheduling</h4>
                <p dir="ltr">If the vehicle is not ready for pickup as scheduled, a rescheduling fee will be charged:
                <ul>
                    <li>• 2-5 days' delay: additional fee applies</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <h4 dir="ltr">9. Inspection Reports</h4>
                <p dir="ltr">The Client is responsible for completing an inspection report at both pickup and delivery. Failure to do so may void the ability to file a damage claim.</p>
                <h4 dir="ltr">10. Non-Operational Vehicles</h4>
                <p dir="ltr">A $150 fee applies to inoperable vehicles and will be included in the final invoice.</p>
                <h4 dir="ltr">11. Cancellation & Refunds</h4>
                <p dir="ltr">Cancellations must be made prior to driver assignment. If no driver was dispatched, a refund minus up to $250 in administrative fees will be provided.</p>
                <h4 dir="ltr">12. Payment & Chargebacks</h4>
                <p dir="ltr">The Client agrees to pay the full quoted price for transport services. No chargebacks will be pursued against the Broker or Carrier. This agreement is governed by the laws of the United States</p>
